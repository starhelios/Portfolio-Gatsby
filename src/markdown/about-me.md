Hey there!

I'm Jackson Noda, and as you might have already read, I'm a Senior Full-Stack engineer. This website was made to showcase all of what I can do and plan to do. Don't judge my writing based on this section though, this is by far my shoddiest work yet.

As a passionate and professional Software Engineer with over 8 years of experience in web and hybrid/native mobile app development, I've built various kinds of web and mobile apps related to Healthcare, Fitness, E-Learning, Social Networking, Ecommerce, Wallet, etc. Also. I've been working in startup and fortune 500 companies for several years.

I want to use my challenge for various kinds of projects and want to get long term clients to extend their business together. I am a strong problem solver and always provide top notch production until 100% satisfaction.

I created this website so I could showcase all this and through this process, make it easier for you to connect with me. If you like what you see, head over to the [contact section](#contact) below and send me a text. I would love to hear from you!
