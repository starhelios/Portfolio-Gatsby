- Technologies : React, Next.js, TailwindCSS, Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, Azure DevOps
- Description: During my tenure working on this project, I employed my deep knowledge of React, Next.js, Vercel, Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, and Azure DevOps to implement an intuitive drag-and-drop feature, enhancing the user experience significantly. By leveraging libraries such as React DnD, I was able to construct a fluid, interactive interface that seamlessly facilitated the reordering of UI elements. This functionality allowed users to personalize their interface, a key requirement for a platform focused on collaboration and customizability. Furthermore, I ensured that the drag-and-drop feature worked harmoniously with the real-time code collaboration tools, integrations, and other components of the application. By prioritizing performance and security, I contributed to the delivery of a top-tier web application development platform used by engineers, analysts, and business stakeholders alike.
