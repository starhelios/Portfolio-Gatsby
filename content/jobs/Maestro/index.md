- Technologies: React, Next.js, Stripe, WebRTC, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, AWS, JWT
- Description: I've developed this interactive video platform using React.js, Styled Components, Next.js, Node.js, MongoDB, and AWS to create an intuitive and responsive user interface. The platform's features, such as two-way communication, personalized experiences, and business insights, are likely implemented via a combination of custom React components and third-party libraries. The real-time nature of the live streaming service might employ technologies like WebSockets or WebRTC for real-time communication, which would be seamlessly integrated with React. Given the high-profile clientele and the data-driven nature of the platform, significant emphasis would be put on security, scalability, and performance optimization in the React application.
